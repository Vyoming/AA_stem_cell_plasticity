Dietary epigenetic reprogramming promotes regenerative cell plasticity and tissue resilience


Analysis Accompanying manuscript

Abstract:
In response to tissue damage, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) acquire stem cell activity to promote regeneration, but whether such plasticity is a normal physiologic property is unclear. Furthermore, cancer cells exploit the plasticity response, posing challenges in developing regenerative therapies to treat intestinal epithelial damage2. Here, we uncovered that a single dietary nutrient, arachidonic acid (AA), induces IEC plasticity under homeostatic conditions and boost intestinal regenerative capacity in the face of various insults, without increasing cancer risk. Dietary AA triggers the tissue regenerative response by activating a conserved epithelial prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) – Ptger4 – cAMP – PKA signaling axis in mice and human models. Mechanistically, AA elicits epigenetic reprogramming to promote IEC plasticity and regeneration by activating transcription factor Creb1 and co-activator Yap1. A key target gene of this transcriptional circuit, S100a6, marks the AA-induced plastic stem cell state and is crucial for the regenerative response to epithelial damage. These findings reveal a nutrient-triggered epigenetic mechanism for regenerative cell plasticity that promotes tissue resilience uncoupled from tumorigenesis. Such pro-regenerative dietary interventions have therapeutic potential for degenerative epithelial conditions.
